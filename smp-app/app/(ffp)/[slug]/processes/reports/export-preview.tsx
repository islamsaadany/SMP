             A report is a document, not a slide deck. Every section used to

             sheet and the next started fresh however much room was left — six
             of thirteen pages under a third used, and about half the paper
             blank. Sections now flow.

             Two divisions still earn a page because they tell a reader where
             they are: the cover, and the start of each process document.

             What may not be split is the BLOCK, not the section. A process
             document measures around four pages, and break-inside: avoid on an
             element taller than the page cannot be honoured — the browser
             ignores it and fragments wherever it lands, which is what cut the

          row — on a real chain that padding alone pushed the page count past
          one. Multi-column flow packs each phase directly under the previous
          one in the same column and moves on to the next column when it runs
          out of room, which is what keeps the whole chain on a single page.
          Four columns, fixed rather than responsive: an A4 landscape page is
          narrower than the lg breakpoint, so a responsive count existed on
          screen and never in the PDF. print-keep keeps a phase's title
          with its own list rather than splitting it across two columns; a
          phase taller than the page still has to break somewhere, and the
          per-activity print-keep is what stops that from cutting an
