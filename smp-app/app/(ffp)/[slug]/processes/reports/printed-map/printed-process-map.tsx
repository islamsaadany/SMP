/**
 * The process map as it prints in the Export Report.
 *
 * Plain HTML, rendered on the server, with no canvas and no client JavaScript.
 * That is the whole rebuild: the previous version drew the map with ReactFlow —
 * absolutely-positioned fixed-size nodes under a scale transform, inside a
 * fixed-height box — which is why every one of its eighteen cards had its label
 * overflowing, why one was clipped by that box, and why the type came out
 * around five points. Text that wraps and boxes that grow to fit their contents
 * give all of that back without a single measurement.
 *
 * It is also what lets a page break fall between two steps rather than through
 * a card, and what finally brings the map under the report's own Spacing
 * control, since everything here is set in rem like the rest of the document.
