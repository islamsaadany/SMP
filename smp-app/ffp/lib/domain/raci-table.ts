/**
 * Which Role columns the RACI table should actually show. A workspace can
 * have far more Roles than any single process needs (e.g. every section head
 * across a whole plant), so the table defaults to only the Roles already in
 * use here — anything with at least one RACI assignment among these rows, or
 * mentioned as a step's owner or supporting department on the Process Map or
 * Value Chain board (mentionedRoleIds) — plus whatever's been explicitly
 * pinned via "+ Add title" (pinnedRoleIds, Process.raciVisibleRoleIds).
 *
 * mentionedRoleIds matters because a process built from the Value Chain
 * board gets its steps' owner and supporting Roles for free — from each
 * Activity's Owner/Supporting Departments — before anyone has clicked a
 * single RACI cell. Without it, a freshly-built process has zero used Roles
 * and zero pins, which used to hit the "never-touched matrix" fallback below
 * and show every workspace Role instead of the handful this process
 * actually involves.
 *
 * The fallback to every workspace Role is now for the genuinely empty case
 * only — a process with no steps yet, or steps with no owner assigned at
 * all — so the table is still never columnless.
