/**
 * Which parts of the Export Report pack appear, and in what order.
 *
 * Three ideas, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   - The **catalogue** below is the only place that knows a section or block
 *     exists. It is code, not data.
 *   - The **stored arrangement** (Workspace.reportArrangement) records a
 *     client's choices about the catalogue: what is included, in what order,
 *     and which section each block sits under.
 *   - **Emptiness** is neither. Whether a block has anything to show is decided
 *     per process at render time, so filling in a client's KPIs makes the
 *     "no data yet" mark disappear without anyone rearranging anything.
 *
 * Keeping the catalogue out of the stored value is what makes a section added
 * to the product later show up for clients arranged before it existed, instead
 * of being hidden from them forever with no error to notice.
