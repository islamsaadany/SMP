/**
 * What a step still needs before it's actually documented.
 *
 * A step can be created anywhere — the Process Map, a bulk paste, the Value
 * Chain board, a spreadsheet import — and every route leaves the same holes:
 * nothing flows into it, nobody is accountable for it, no approver is named.
 * The RACI and Authority matrices each flag their own gap on their own page,
 * which only helps someone already looking at that page. This collects them so
 * a step can carry its own unfinished business wherever it's shown.
 *
 * It deliberately runs the *same* builders and validators those two pages use
 * rather than re-deriving the rules: a row belongs to an Activity when the step
 * has one and to the step itself when it doesn't, and an authority assignment
 * is keyed by whichever of the two it was attached to. Re-implementing that
 * lookup is how a chip ends up disagreeing with the matrix it's summarising.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free (Constitution Principle III).
