/**
 * The value-chain board: every step across the engagement, laid out in the

 * the money being collected — across processes, not inside one.
 *
 * The board groups two ways. **By phase** is the value chain itself, columns in
 * the order the work happens. **By owner** takes the same cards and columns
 * them by the department accountable for each, which answers a different
 * question — how much of the chain sits on one team — from the same data.

 * Pure and framework-free (Constitution Principle III): steps in, columns out,
